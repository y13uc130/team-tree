Welcome! This is a Team Tree

## 🚀 Steps to Run the App

1. nvm install 20 (if not already installed)
2. nvm use 20
3. npm install
4. npm run dev
5. Drag/Drop the employee cards, Have fun. You can filter the names in side bar and select the desired team from dropdown.

## ⚠️ Notes
This version is desktop-only (no tablet/mobile responsiveness yet)

Focused mostly on logic of drag and drop with the updated Lines. To make it better and scalable and flexible, we can use react-d3-tree kind of libraries which give us inbuilt functionality of such tree formations.

## 🛠️ Things to Improve (if more time available)

1. Responsiveness
2. Restful API mock handling
3. Test cases to be added.
